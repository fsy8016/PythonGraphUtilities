Tree.py and Node.py contain the classes for the data structures used to run the visualization. Run.py is essntially just a main function that also has
elements of customizability to it.

USAGE:
Execute run.py and follow the instructions.

NOTES: it will crash if you don't input 0 or 1 into the terminal.
DO NOT INPUT "1" or "2" or else it will crash as well. Just input 1 or 2.

The tree can be edited by going into run.py and changing the initialization settings.
Comments for the usage of that code can be found in that file.
Something to note is that there is also an implementation for bolding in the code but will not work with all terminals.
